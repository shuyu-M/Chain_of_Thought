Question: ""To segment the green leaves and stem [4 marks]:""

Rubric:
Score 2: Clearly and specifically addresses the key requirement by covering saturation low, saturation, and intensity with accurate details
Score 1: Covers some key elements (at least 2 of: saturation low, saturation, and intensity) but lacks clarity or misses essential detail
Score 0: Does not address the key requirement or fails to mention saturation low, saturation, and intensity

Student Response: ""To segment green leaves and stem we apply a threshold of range of values around 120 degree which corresponds to green. the range we should use must be broader than applied in previous part as the shade of green is more darker. Similar to before no threshold on intensity and saturation.""
