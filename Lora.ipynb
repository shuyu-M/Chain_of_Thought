When declaration is separated from definition, then names of all the member functions inside a particular class can be found at the same place and it would make the body of the class look less cumbersome.\\n2.) When the functions are declared first and then defined later, then during defining a particular member function, we can use the other member functions of the class too inside this function\\'s definition as they were already declared earlier and hence there will be no error. \\n3.) Instead of writing a single long function, we can divide the function into two parts and then, use one of the function in the other function. For example, we can write a function to eject a drink from the vending machine, eject_drink(int drinkid) and also another function insert_coin(int value) which will take in the coin and find the drinkid corresponding to the inserted coin. We can declare both these functions in the vending machine in the start and then we can use eject_drink function inside insert_coin function to eject the drink after knowing the drinkid instead of a single long function which finds the drinkid and also ejects it.\\n4.) The advantage from the example explained in the 3rd point can be seen during debugging as there will be separate functions for finding drinkid and ejecting drink i.e., each function will have a single objective instead of having multiple objectives.\",\"The code will be more clear and easier for the reader to understand.
