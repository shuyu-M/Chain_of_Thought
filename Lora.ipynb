Readability. That is, while reading the class member functions and variables, one can easily locate a member function that is being searched for. Further, one can get a rough overview of what the class is trying to accomplish without getting into the gritty details by just looking at the declaration of the member functions.\\n2. Use of global variables. Although this need not apply to everyone, personally, if I would like to use a global variable and change its value when the function is called, I would like to first declare all the classes which I would be using in my program and then declare the global variables and finally, at the end, just before I write my main function, I would write the definition of the member function.\\n\\nPlease assign a score (0,1,2) and briefly explain your reasoning.\",\"Score: 1\\nFeedback: \"\\n\"Question: Q1.
