219127.0,Two      advantages of separating declaration from definition are: .....,"1.

2. Another benefit is that we can define the functions tailored as per the requirements of the class, and we don't need to think about what definition should we make in the superclass. For example, when defining the function area() for class square, we'll have to return s*s, while for circle::area() we'll have to return 3.14*s*s.

(e.g., forkret) and the kernel stack of the child process is setup such that the return address is

Child process needs context to execute in the kernel mode.
- The context for execution of the child is setup to start execution at the start of a function
(e.g., forkret) and the kernel stack of the child process is setup such that the return address is
set as the return of the trap handler (e.g., trapret)
- As a result, when a child process in the kernel is scheduled, it starts executing in a function
and returns from it to the return address (the trap handler return address).
- This emulates a call to the trap handler and a return from the handler and then proceeds with
the rest of the kernel stack unrolling to return to user space.",0,"The provided answer does not address the question of how the child process returns from a trap. It instead states that the return path is via cret and ochpath, which are not relevant to the question. It also mentions the value of eax, which is not part of the context switching process."

42546.0,"c. When the fork() system call is made the child process is (almost) identical to the parent
process. In the parent process, the return path from kernel mode to user mode happens via
the trap/interrupt handler (system call is a trap/interrupt).
Explain the return path from the kernel mode to the user mode for the child process.
Specifically, there was no trap in the child process, so how does the child process return from
a trap?"," In Ark, first a new process is allocated with most entries of its PCB being the same as the parent process'. Its state is marked as READY or RUNNABLE.
Its trapframe is populated so that its execution point and stack is the same as the parent and the return value on the stack is set to 0 so that it is identifiable as the child process.
When the schedules is invoked after the child process creation is complete, it sees that both parent and child, both are returning from a trap (because of how the trapframe of the child is populated). Then the scheduler schedules the next process based on its logic, and when the child process is scheduled, the first thing it does is return from trap. It is as if the child process executed everything before that in exactly the same way as the parent and got into a trap when timer() was called.","- When a child process is created and is ready to execute, it is in the kernel mode.
Child process needs context to execute in the kernel mode.
- The context for execution of the child is setup to start execution at the start of a function
(e.g., forkret) and the kernel stack of the child process is setup such that the return address is
set as the return of the trap handler (e.g., trapret)
- As a result, when a child process in the kernel is scheduled, it starts executing in a function
and returns from it to the return address (the trap handler return address).
- This emulates a call to the trap handler and a return from the handler and then proceeds with
the rest of the kernel stack unrolling to return to user space.",1,"Your answer captures the idea of populating the child process's trapframe to emulate a return from the trap handler.

set as the return of the trap handler (e.g., trapret)
