Remember, the process of coagulation itself is responsible for the changes in alkalinity."
46910.0,During coagulation process alkalinity reduces due to the ___________________________,"due to decrease the OH- ion concentration, because there is polynucleo complex formation .","As coagulation is done,the OH- tend to form more bonds with the molecules in the sample, and H+ concentration increases which lowers the pH level.",1,"While the student's response correctly states that a decrease in OH- ion concentration is responsible for the reduction in alkalinity, it fails to provide a complete picture. The reference answer correctly highlights how the formation of bonds between OH- and molecules in the sample leads to an increase in H+ concentration, resulting in a lower pH level. To improve, the student should explore the mechanism behind the polynucleo complex formation and its impact on OH- ion concentration."

Consider reviewing the concepts related to the interaction of OH- ions with other molecules during coagulation to better understand this aspect."
46910.0,During coagulation process alkalinity reduces due to the ___________________________,reduction in carbonate concentration,"As coagulation is done,the OH- tend to form more bonds with the molecules in the sample, and H+ concentration increases which lowers the pH level.",0,"  Your response is incorrect. The reduction in OH- ions during coagulation causes an increase in the concentration of H+ ions, resulting in a decrease in alkalinity.   "

46910.0,During coagulation process alkalinity reduces due to the ___________________________,release of protons in a solution . For example Alum,"As coagulation is done,the OH- tend to form more bonds with the molecules in the sample, and H+ concentration increases which lowers the pH level.",0,"  The student's answer correctly mentions the release of protons. However, it should explain the reason behind this release, which is the formation of more bonds between OH- and the sample molecules.   "
46910.0,During coagulation process alkalinity reduces due to the ___________________________,because alkanity react with coagulant to form sticky ppt hydroxo components,"As coagulation is done,the OH- tend to form more bonds with the molecules in the sample, and H+ concentration increases which lowers the pH level.",0,  It might be helpful to consider the composition of the coagulant and how it interacts with the alkalinity in the water during the coagulation process.   
46910.0,During coagulation process alkalinity reduces due to the ___________________________,maintainance of pH higher and reduce NOM normal,"As coagulation is done,the OH- tend to form more bonds with the molecules in the sample, and H+ concentration increases which lowers the pH level.",0,"  The provided answer does not address the change in alkalinity during the coagulation process. It talks about maintaining a higher pH and reducing NOM, which are different aspects of water treatment.   "
46910.0,During coagulation process alkalinity reduces due to the ___________________________,formation of larger flocs or precipitates.,"As coagulation is done,the OH- tend to form more bonds with the molecules in the sample, and H+ concentration increases which lowers the pH level.",0,"The alkalinity reduction during coagulation is not directly linked to the formation of larger flocs or precipitates.

46910.0,During coagulation process alkalinity reduces due to the ___________________________,forming precipation with the coagulent,"As coagulation is done,the OH- tend to form more bonds with the molecules in the sample, and H+ concentration increases which lowers the pH level.",0,"Coagulation is a process where particles are removed from suspension by the addition of a coagulant, which causes them to form larger particles that can settle out of solution. Alkalinity is a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions in water. The student's answer is incorrect because the formation of precipitation does not directly cause a reduction in alkalinity."
46910.0,During coagulation process alkalinity reduces due to the ___________________________,"Due to addition of coagulants, PH decreases due to acidic nature","As coagulation is done,the OH- tend to form more bonds with the molecules in the sample, and H+ concentration increases which lowers the pH level.",1,"  The acidity increases because of coagulant addition, not because of its acidic nature. Coagulants neutralize alkalinity by reacting with OH- ions, leading to a decrease in pH.   "
46910.0,During coagulation process alkalinity reduces due to the ___________________________,addition of coagulants and more chlorination,"As coagulation is done,the OH- tend to form more bonds with the molecules in the sample, and H+ concentration increases which lowers the pH level.",0,"  The given answer doesn't capture the actual reason behind the reduction of alkalinity. It is caused by the formation of bonds between OH- ions and molecules in the sample, resulting in an increase in H+ ions and lowering of pH level.   "
46910.0,During coagulation process alkalinity reduces due to the ___________________________,due to decrease in pH by after coagulants works start,"As coagulation is done,the OH- tend to form more bonds with the molecules in the sample, and H+ concentration increases which lowers the pH level.",1,"The response correctly points out a decrease in pH as a result of the coagulation process. However, it would be more accurate to describe the underlying factor causing the pH change as the formation of bonds between OH- and molecules in the sample, leading to an increase in H+ concentration."

 The argument that conditional statements check only once is correct, but the feedback can be improved to also provide information about why spinning might be needed even with loops. For example:

""Conditional statements do check only once, but loops are used in spinlocks because there might be a delay between the time a thread checks the lock status and the time it actually acquires the lock. During this delay, other threads might try to acquire the lock, so the looping helps to ensure that the thread eventually acquires the lock."""
