42546.0,"c. When the fork() system call is made the child process is (almost) identical to the parent
process. In the parent process, the return path from kernel mode to user mode happens via
the trap/interrupt handler (system call is a trap/interrupt).
Explain the return path from the kernel mode to the user mode for the child process.
Specifically, there was no trap in the child process, so how does the child process return from
a trap?"," The kernel captures important information like the address of instruction to return to, as well as the return value, among other things, which are required to resume user process execution, in the trapframe.

The way fork behaves is that the child process's trapframe is copied from the parent's trapframe (with a definite change being in the return value of fork()).

Thus, the return-from-trap operation has the access to the information about which instruction address to continue from (eip). This is the same for parent and child, thus both return to the same instruction when scheduled by the scheduler.","- When a child process is created and is ready to execute, it is in the kernel mode.
Child process needs context to execute in the kernel mode.
- The context for execution of the child is setup to start execution at the start of a function
(e.g., forkret) and the kernel stack of the child process is setup such that the return address is
set as the return of the trap handler (e.g., trapret)
- As a result, when a child process in the kernel is scheduled, it starts executing in a function
and returns from it to the return address (the trap handler return address).
- This emulates a call to the trap handler and a return from the handler and then proceeds with
the rest of the kernel stack unrolling to return to user space.",1,"Your answer correctly identifies that the child process's trapframe is copied from the parent's, allowing both to return to the same instruction when scheduled.

42546.0,"c. When the fork() system call is made the child process is (almost) identical to the parent
process. In the parent process, the return path from kernel mode to user mode happens via
the trap/interrupt handler (system call is a trap/interrupt).
Explain the return path from the kernel mode to the user mode for the child process.
Specifically, there was no trap in the child process, so how does the child process return from
a trap?"," The fork() system call was called inside parent, but both parent and child return from fork as two separate processes.
fork creates a trap frame for the child process and puts return value as 0 in it. This happens because fork behaves as follows:
1. identical FCB (except pid) and virtual address space.
2. fork() , after creating the new process, puts return value 0 in the stack of the child process. Therefore, when child process is scheduled, it behaves as if it has just returned from trap with return value as 0. (fork with a new trap frame)
3. Then stk() returns child's pid for parent as usual.

5 steps:
1. stk
2. child obj
3. fork copies this form parent VA space.
4. 0'
5. return value

parent VA   child VA
Therefore, child and parent are identical except pid and return addresses of fork.","- When a child process is created and is ready to execute, it is in the kernel mode.
Child process needs context to execute in the kernel mode.
- The context for execution of the child is setup to start execution at the start of a function
(e.g., forkret) and the kernel stack of the child process is setup such that the return address is
set as the return of the trap handler (e.g., trapret)
- As a result, when a child process in the kernel is scheduled, it starts executing in a function
and returns from it to the return address (the trap handler return address).
- This emulates a call to the trap handler and a return from the handler and then proceeds with
the rest of the kernel stack unrolling to return to user space.",2,"Your answer thoroughly explains the process of how the child process returns from kernel mode.

42546.0,"c. When the fork() system call is made the child process is (almost) identical to the parent
process. In the parent process, the return path from kernel mode to user mode happens via
the trap/interrupt handler (system call is a trap/interrupt).
Explain the return path from the kernel mode to the user mode for the child process.
Specifically, there was no trap in the child process, so how does the child process return from
a trap?"," * There was no trap in the child process, but the fork system calls set up the process / kernel stack in such a way that when the child process is scheduled, the kernel is as if it had earlier trapped into the kernel.
* In other words, the fork syscall fills up the kernel stack manually to make it look like it had trapped ie it fills up the stack with context / registers and other things that are to be popped from the stack during process trap. This is because the kernel has return address corresponding to the iret f and hence the first time the process is scheduled it returns from trap!
* For the return value, 0 is explicitly stored in eax and stored on stack which acts as the return value. 
* So, basically the return path for the child process is also through trap handles like the parent, the only difference being it was never actually trapped so we have to setup kernel during process creation such that it creates an illusion that the process was trapped to kernel mode.","- When a child process is created and is ready to execute, it is in the kernel mode.
Child process needs context to execute in the kernel mode.
- The context for execution of the child is setup to start execution at the start of a function
(e.g., forkret) and the kernel stack of the child process is setup such that the return address is
set as the return of the trap handler (e.g., trapret)
- As a result, when a child process in the kernel is scheduled, it starts executing in a function
and returns from it to the return address (the trap handler return address).
- This emulates a call to the trap handler and a return from the handler and then proceeds with
the rest of the kernel stack unrolling to return to user space.",1,"Your answer is mostly correct. However, you could have explained that the return address in the child process is set to the trap handler return address.

It is possible that even f itself calls g for some condition. In this case no order of writing the functions will be correct and we will always get an error. The solution to this is to declare all your methods in the class body and then define them seperately outside in any order convenient and it will be right. 
2) When methods are defined and declared at the same place it makes the class definition unnecessarily lengthy. Often we need to add a layer of abstraction between the two. It is very convenient for the developer to have all the methods of a class defined at one place for quick reference without worrying about their detailed definition. Hence it is better to define only the declarations at once inside class body and the definitions seperately outside. ","The code will be more clear and easier for the reader to understand. Allows easy changing, debugging, and overriding of the functions. Enhances modularity of the code. This also separates the abstraction from the implementation.",1,"You have understood the concept of separating declaration from definition well.

42546.0,"c. When the fork() system call is made the child process is (almost) identical to the parent
process. In the parent process, the return path from kernel mode to user mode happens via
the trap/interrupt handler (system call is a trap/interrupt).
Explain the return path from the kernel mode to the user mode for the child process.
Specifically, there was no trap in the child process, so how does the child process return from
a trap?"," The child process did not have a trap.
It was just initialized & created by the trap handler and so, it doesn't return via the trap handler. Instead, the child process is simply kept as a part of the process table with status READY.
Thus, when the kernel is done & we get a timer interrupt, the schedulers can decide to schedule this child process.

The schedulers calls the switch() fn to jump to the context of the child function and in this way we enter the user mode of the child function.
This is how we return from the kernel mode to the user mode (on the child process).","- When a child process is created and is ready to execute, it is in the kernel mode.
Child process needs context to execute in the kernel mode.
- The context for execution of the child is setup to start execution at the start of a function
(e.g., forkret) and the kernel stack of the child process is setup such that the return address is
set as the return of the trap handler (e.g., trapret)
- As a result, when a child process in the kernel is scheduled, it starts executing in a function
and returns from it to the return address (the trap handler return address).
- This emulates a call to the trap handler and a return from the handler and then proceeds with
the rest of the kernel stack unrolling to return to user space.",1,"Your explanation of how the child process is initialized and created is correct. However, your understanding of how the child process returns from the kernel mode is not entirely accurate. While the child process starts executing in a function (forkret) and returns from it to the return address (trap handler return address), the return path from the kernel mode to the user mode is more nuanced.

42546.0,"c. When the fork() system call is made the child process is (almost) identical to the parent
process. In the parent process, the return path from kernel mode to user mode happens via
the trap/interrupt handler (system call is a trap/interrupt).
Explain the return path from the kernel mode to the user mode for the child process.
Specifically, there was no trap in the child process, so how does the child process return from
a trap?"," Here is how this works:
When the parent process calls fork, a new process is created which is almost an exact copy of the parent process. This includes copying the kernel stack data and the hence the trapframe is the state within state.
We accordingly set the return address from where the process must return and slap other registers such as eip - set accordingly.
Because the kernel stacks of the processes look identical (except the return value), both processes behave as if they were in the same state of execution. Hence when the child process is initiated, it will appear as if it just returned from trap, because that is the state it is in as soon as it is created.","- When a child process is created and is ready to execute, it is in the kernel mode.
Child process needs context to execute in the kernel mode.
- The context for execution of the child is setup to start execution at the start of a function
(e.g., forkret) and the kernel stack of the child process is setup such that the return address is
set as the return of the trap handler (e.g., trapret)
- As a result, when a child process in the kernel is scheduled, it starts executing in a function
and returns from it to the return address (the trap handler return address).
- This emulates a call to the trap handler and a return from the handler and then proceeds with
the rest of the kernel stack unrolling to return to user space.",1,"Your answer provides an overview of the process but it does not specifically address how the child process returns from a trap. To improve your response, you should explicitly state that the return address in the child process's kernel stack is set to the trap handler's return address.

324834.0,What are the critical issues involved in design of an online compression system for space applications?,The compressed image should be small enough to fit into down link communication channel. But at the Same time it should not be compressed to such high rates that it under utilizes the communication channel. It is essential to ensure that the compression sytem is able to achieve it.,Data rate should not exceed the channel capacity. Full capacity of the communication channel should be utilized. Maximum quality should be preserved.,2,You have correctly identified the need for balancing compression to fit the communication channel capacity while preserving the maximum possible quality. This demonstrates a good understanding of the fundamental issues in online compression system design for space applications.
344838.0,What is conveyed by the very low eigenvalues with principal component transform applied to high dimensional data?,The vector with lowest eigen value has lowest variance. we can drop that feature.,A very low eigen value refers to axes (eigenvectors) along which the data has very low variance and are highly corelated with some other vector. These axes are not useful and can be discard during dimensionality reduction.,2,"Excellent! You've correctly understood the significance of low eigenvalues in principal component transformation. Remember, these eigenvalues indicate features with minimal data variance and high correlation, making them less informative. This knowledge is crucial for effective dimensionality reduction."

42544.0,"a. List and explain two privileged actions that an user process may attempt to perform and which
are prevented by the OS via the limited-directed execution setup.
Note that the user process has to know specifically how to make such an attempt.
(e.g., the user process does not know that a PCB exists and hence may not know how to
update its contents)."," - The user process may attempt to modify memory, which is part of the kernel's address space. This is clearly a privileged instruction, as the kernel has critical information in its address space, and cannot be accessed by a user process.
- The user process may try to write assembly code to modify values of registers like CR3 of IDTR. These are privileged instructions, since CR3 stores address of current processes' page directory, and IDTR stores address of IDT, which is set up by OS at boot time. So user process cannot be allowed to modify such critical sectors.","- Write to CR3 register to modify page directory pointer
- Write to the EFLAGS registers to modify execution status (zero bit, interrupt enable/disable)
- Write to the IDTR register to change location of IDT
- Access to VA that lies in the kernel virtual address range",2,Your answer is well explained and covers crucial privileged actions that the user process may attempt to execute. You have correctly identified the attempts to modify memory within the kernel's address space and the manipulation of registers like CR3 and IDTR as privileged instructions. Keep up the good work!
